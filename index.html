			<p><span class= "about">Hi, my name is Britta Heggeland and I am a current College Senior. In December 2020 I will graduate with a BA in Mathematics and Minors in Spanish, Computer Science, and Science. Math has alway been my favorite subject, and I am thrilled that I will be able to turn something that I love so much into my career. When I graduate, I plan on attending Graduate School to study Cryptography or Cybersecurity. I hope to one day work for the US Government. <br><br>

			In my spare time I enjoy many hobbies such as volleyball, making music, and reading. I am a member of the Trinity Christian College Womens' Volleyball team, and in the 2019 season was Second Team All-Conference. Throughout my life I have played various instruments such as the piano, guitar, violin, and ukulele. I also love to sing and am a member of a worship team at my school.
